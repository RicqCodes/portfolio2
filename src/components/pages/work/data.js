          Forkify is a recipe app with over a million recipes for different
          kinds of dishes. This application was built solely on plain vanilla
          js, and it's a work-through on one of the courses i learnt javascript.
          After i had finished the course went back to see if i could redo it
          from sratch, and that's why we have it here.
